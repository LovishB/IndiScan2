The primary function of a Indiscan app is to capture the image of a document using the camera or select from gallery. Once the image is captured, the Indiscan app may offer a range of tools to enhance the image quality, such as adjusting the brightness, contrast, and sharpness, removing shadows or reflections, and correcting skew or distortion.
